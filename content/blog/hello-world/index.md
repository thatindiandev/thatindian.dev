How do we publish our own blog?

How will it be?

How will it feel like to get our own blog?

Have you ever thought about these things? I am sure, you must have. Owning a personal blog is a dream come to true for 
every developer. After publishing their first ever 'Hello world' blog post on the web, you must see their 
excitement, their achievement face, and those stars in that eyes ðŸ¤©, priceless! With just releasing one post out there, they must be
thinking to publish more content, share posts, _make the world a better place_, and a Million more things must be 
going on inside that poor mind.

By this time you must be thinking, and whatever you are thinking is absolutely right.

Yeah! yes, this is THAT post. Just started with lots of hope, excitement and zero idea of what to write next ðŸ˜…

Note: To the all the people with good hearts hoping to read my next post, and the person who is currently reading 
[yes, you!] this post after it's been published long ago, if you don't find any other post in the list, 
please consider this as first and last post that died with the monkey-minded developer, who
tried, got high on coding and moved on to trying next npm package. [Did you see? what i did there with npm ðŸ˜†]

Until then, this is __Shajahan__ and welcome to my blog!
